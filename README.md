# CS 528: Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing

Coursework and projects for the WPI class CS 528: Mobile and Ubiquitous
Computing, taught by Professor Emmanuel Agu in fall 2020.

## Project 0

This is a simple "Hello world" app that displays my name in TextViews.

## Project 1

The purpose of this project is to get students familiar with Android layouts
and various graphical elements. It consists of four "screens," separate
projects that intend to replicate a UI mockup in Android Studio.

## Project 2

This project expands an existing app by adding functionality to its user
interface and enabling face recognition and OCR using Google's APIs. Users can
take pictures that the app will scan for recognized faces and text.

## Project 3

Project 3 involves sensor programming, activity recognition, geofencing, and
Google Maps in a mashup of various features unique to mobile computing. 

## Final Project - COVID Traveler

We developed an app that leverages location services, a convolutional neural
network for face mask detection, and ubiquitous computing to provide users with
reliable, up to date information about COVID-19 in their environment.

The app provides information about the current COVID threat-level in the user's
town/city, sourced from the state of Massachusetts website. It also uses safety
data for individual stores and places crowdsourced from users. Users can submit
pictures of themselves or others to our server, and the server uses machine
learning to detect whether the subjects are properly wearing face masks.

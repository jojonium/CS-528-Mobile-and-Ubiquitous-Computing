Coursework and projects for the WPI class CS 528: Mobile and Ubiquitous
Computing

## Project 0

This is a simple "Hello world" app that displays my name in TextViews.

## Project 1

The purpose of this project is to get students familiar with Android layouts
and various graphical elements. It consists of four "screens," separate
projects that intend to replicate a UI mockup in Android Studio.

## Project 2

This project expands an existing app by adding functionality to its user
interface and enabling face recognition and OCR using Google's APIs. Users can
take pictures that the app will scan for recognized faces and text.
